## Dora Kemeny

I am known as a patient, empathic and happy person who is open to the world and not afraid of the unknown. When I face challenges, I do not panic but try to find a solution either as a member of a team or by myself. I like to study, improve my skills and widen my knowledge.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.
